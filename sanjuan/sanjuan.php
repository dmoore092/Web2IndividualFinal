                <h2>The Capital</h2>
                <p class="clearfix">
                    The first two times we went to Puerto Rico, we went to San Juan. It seemed like the obvious place
                    to go when travelling to the island and not knowing much about it. San Juan, for sure, didn't
                    disappoint. Both times we rented from AirBnB, and got great places. The first time was a little
                    bungalow behind the owners house, with a private pool. The second was a condo in a gated community
                    with access to a pool, the beach, and a BBQ area that we used often.
                </p>
                <h2>Beach Town</h2>
                <div class="body-copy-flex">
                    <p>
                        San Juan, despite being a city, has some gorgeous beaches. This is a picture of
                        the beach we spent most of our time on. I love the high rise buildings, which are hotels and
                        condos, right on the beach. Despite what you'd think, they beach was never that busy, and we
                        were always able to find a place and enjoy the water. While we were here, some turtles had
                        come onto the beach to lay eggs, so the authorities had sectioned off the area so they turtle
                        eggs could hatch without being bothered by tourists.

                <h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the great things about San Juan is how close it is to nearby attractions. Just a short
                    drive away is <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/elyunque">El Yunque</a>, a US National Forrest.
                    It is the only Tropical Rain Forrest in the US! you can drive through the forrest and stop
                    along the way for great views and different structures like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokah%C3%BA_Tower">
                        Yakahu tower</a>. At the moment,
                    the park is closed "until further notice". Hurricane Maria destroyed much of the park
                    and they have decided to close the park indefinitely.
