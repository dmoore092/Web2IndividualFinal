                <h2>Boat Rentals</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the boat you get with a boat rental. We rented from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ginas-at-Johnnys-Boats-La-Parguera-158536400892689/">
                    Gina's at Johnny's Boats</a>. It was a great little shop that you just walk up to, tell them how
                    long you expect to keep the boat for, and pay by the hour. If you go over, you just pay the difference when
                    you get back. The only warning I would give, would be to steer clear of the bigger boats coming in and out
                    of the bay area. The boat you get is tiny, and can get tossed around quite a bit by the wakes of the bigger
                    boats, and the engine is not very powerful so it doesn't move very fast. Another thing to consider is
                    some areas of the bay are very shallow. It's nice in one regard, as you can jump off the side of the boat
                    and relax in the water for a bit, but it also means that the propeller on the boat can hit rocks and other
                    debris. So be careful there.

            This is me driving the boat, and sam sitting in the front. You can see how absolutely beautiful the water
            is in this pic. There was even a place out in the middle of the bay where lots of boats had gathered and
            people tied up their boats together and were out in the water enjoying themselves. We preferred to drive
            around the bay, checking out each of islands that were scattered around the area. We ended up going back to
            the swimming island a couple of times, to each lunch and relax.

                <h2>Island Swimming</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here is a great picture of the swimming area. Under the dock is a fence so that critters can't swim in, and
                        the island acts as a natural barriers on the other side. On the far end of the dock is where the entrance to
                        the island is, and where the picnic tables and iguanas are. you can see our boat docked just to the left.
