                <h2>Hidden Gem</h2>
                <p>
                    La Parguera is a great little town in the southwest corner of Puerto Rico. The first time we went there the town was dead empty. We popped into a bar for a drink, and I remember asking the bartender in Spanish if the construction was the reason there was no one around? Her reply had us both laughing, she replied; "No, es Martes" meaning, "No, it's just Tuesday".</p><p>We would later find out that it really was a hidden gem that most tourists and locals alike didn't really know about. Later on our second trip we went back and found there was much more to do, and many more people there. Here's a pic of Sam standing on a brand new section of town. Right in front of her is a sort of boardwalk with little huts selling adventure tours to the Bioluminescent Bay, as well as other tours to see the Mangroves.

                In the boating section I talk about this place a little more. It is an island that is off the coast, and
                you can rent small boats for very cheap and head out to this place. There is a boat dock where you can tie off,
                then on the other side of the dock is a fenced in pool area. The fence keeps critters out while letting
                ocean water in. It had a great sandy bed underneath and was about chest height. It was great! the island
                itself has picnic tables and we got to see some giant iguanas as well. It also had some of absolutely
                gorgeous views.

        <h2>Don't miss this town!</h2>
        <p>
            If you can fit it in, La Parguera is not a place that should be missed. It's best to come during the weekday,
            because we found out that the weekends are much busier, that is can be hard to find parking. If you can only
            make it on a weekend, you should still go as the place never gets completely swamped with people, you'll just
            have to park farther away. There are also hotels and other places to stay if you want to stay in town. I met
            some people who were staying in town for a full week to go out scuba diving everyday. They loved how chill
            and laid back the town was, especially in the evening.
