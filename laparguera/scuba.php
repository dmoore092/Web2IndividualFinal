                <h2>Paradise Scuba</h2>
                <p>
                    Anytime we go somewhere, Sam sits on the beach and I look for a scuba trip. I became scuba certified in 2015,
                    and have since dove in 4 countries and I love it. This is how I found La Parguera in the first place. I hooked
                    up with a dive outfit called <a href="http://www.paradisescubasnorkelingpr.com/">Paradise Scuba</a>. They
                    were one of the best dive outfits that I've experienced. Their boat, pictured here, was great! Their dive
                    sites are also fantastic and their dive masters were top notch.
                </p>

        <h2>Diving my own dive</h2>
        <div class="body-copy-flex">
        <p>
            One of the things I loved most about diving with them was the way they handled the dives. Normally the way
            a dive trip works, is that on the boat, they pair you up with a buddy and you guys stick together throughout
            the dive. If one of you uses up all of your available air, or want to see different things, then you have to
            compromise. However with Paradise Scuba, they had everyone
            dive alone, but they sent several dive masters down with the whole group, and it was their job to make sure
            that no one was getting lost or into trouble. So I got to dive my own dive, taking as long as I wanted and
            seeing what I wanted to see.

        <h2>Don't bother diving in San Juan</h2>
        <p>
            I have gone scuba diving twice in Puerto Rico now, once in San Juan, and once in La Parguera. The dive in
            San Juan was terrible in comparison. The water was rough, and very silty from the bottom of the ocean being
            kicked around. In contract, the dive sites off La Parguera were great! Visibility was exactly what you'd
            expect in the caribbean, we got to see lots of wildlife like turtles, barracudas, crabs, fish, and amazing
            corals. They also do certification training as well as taking people on their first dives to see if they
            like it. Rather than leaving you alone to dive, they would pair you up with a dive master who teaches you
            about safety and then does the dive with you, just to make sure you're ok.
