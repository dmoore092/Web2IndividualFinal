        <p>
            Rincon had a lot to offer in the way of places to get drinks. From many roadside bars where you can get
            fruity island drinks, to an American style microbrew pub, to a headbanging rocker bar. We are not big
            party animals, but we like going out to interesting bars and having a few drinks and chatting with locals
            and bartenders.

                <h2>Rincon Beer Company</h2>
                <p>
                    Rincon Beer Company was a place we went back to again and again. It's an American style brew pub that
                    always had a nice selection of microbrews from the mainland, a couple of local beers, and they always
                    had ciders for Sam. There was usually a nice crowd of young people there hanging out and enjoying the
                    evenings. It helps that it's located right in the heart of the town of Rincon so there was lots of
                    people watching to do, and the main strip was a place for locals to show off their tricked out vehicles.

        <h2>La Estacion</h2>
            <div>
                <p>While walking around downtown Rincon, we could hear the sound of heavy metal music, which is usual for the island. Following the sound, we found
                a bar that you could easily mistake for a mechanic's garage if it weren't for the patrons moving in and out, and the tiny taco shop set up outside.</p><p> It turns out
                we had found La Estación(The Station), which is run by mainlanders who moved to Puerto Rico generations
                ago, and they did their own take on a biker bar. The taco stand out front was run by a woman who had Celiac as well, so she made Sam some very delicious gluten free tacos. We ended up going back here several times as well.</p>

                    <p>
                        This last place isn't a place, it's more of a type of bar. One of the things we love to do in Puerto
                        Rico is just drive around and see what we can find. Often times, taking a road you would otherwise skip
                        can lead to hidden treasures, such as where this was taken. We found this tiny local bar down by the
                        ocean, in a place where you'd never need to go if you weren't looking to get lost. The people are always
                        nice, the drinks always cold, and the views are always breathtaking.
