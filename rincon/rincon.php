        <p>
            One of the best things about Ricon is the sunset. Since Rincon sits on the western edge of the island, it
            gets a spectacular view of the sun as it goes down over the ocean. Every night we spent in Ricon we would
            be on the beach at sunset just enjoying the breeze and watching the sun set.

        <h2>World Famous</h2>
        <p>
            In 1968, the World Surfing Championship came to Rincon, and put it on the map. Since then it has
            been a destination for Americans who move to the island, living side by side with the locals. An
            example of this that we witnessed, was a local art festival being held in the town square. There were
            paintings, woodwork, and all other manner of art you could think of, being sold by locals to tourists
            and anyone else who happened the wander by. On the next night, was a movie night in the square, where
            they held a showing of the movie Moana, presented in spoken Spanish with English captions.

                    <h2>AirBnB</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is pretty much how I spent my entire vacation there! We rented an apt on
                        AirBnB, which we do whenever we travel. It's great to have an entire apartment to ourselves, and we
                        can save a little money(and calories!) by cooking our own breakfast before we head out the door to
                        see the beach in the early morning.

                        This beach was fantastic, and was less than a 30 second walk
                        from our apartment. It was almost always empty, save for local kids doing some beach fishing. It also
                        had a great view of <a href="http://villacofresi.com/">Villa Cofresi</a> down the beach, with its
                        patrons riding jet ski's, paragliding, and just generally enjoying the water.
