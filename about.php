        <h3>How I satisified the requirements of the project:</h3>
        <h4>1. Original JavaScript Componet</h4>
        <div class="fig-move">
            <p>My mobile navigation is my original JavaScript element.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>2. DHTML Element</h4>
        <div class="fig-move">
            <p>My DHTML element is a figcaption that rises when you hover over an image.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>3. Corrections from Project1</h4>
        <div class="fig-move">
            <p>A. Typos fixed.</p>
            <p>B. More paragraphs to break up large amounts of text.</p>
            <p>C. Subheadings have been added to futher increase whitespace and break apart large blocks of text.</p>
            <p>D. Font changed to Sans Serif.</p>
            <p>E. Fixed alignment issues, particularly with the header. I moved the local nav down so that the main image displays across       the center. Footer is also now aligned with the rest of the site.</p>
            <p>F. Added a background color to the local navigation in order to make it stand out more. This had the added benefit of using more blue throughout the site.</p>
            <p>G. All repeated code has been moved to includes.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Extras</h4>
        <div class="fig-move">
            <p>1. Added an automatically updating RSS feed to the footer that displays news headlines relating to Puerto Rico.</p>
            <p>2. Added a No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA to the comments page.</p>
            <p>3. Added FavIcon, Touch icons for both Android and iOS for when a user saves my website to their mobile homescreen, and added 3 sizes of Microsoft Windows 10 live tiles.</p>
            <p>4. Added a Google Translate widget to the website. Translates the text of the website into many languages.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Citations:</h3>
        <div class="fig-move">
            <p>All content and code was written by me, and all pictures were taken by me, unless they have a citation in the
            figcaption under the image. Those citations are listed below.</p>
